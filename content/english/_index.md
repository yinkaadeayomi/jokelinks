  title: "What We Stand For"
  description: "Planet 3R is a social enterprise dedicated to converting textile and plastic wastes into eco-friendly products using the 3R ( Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) to save our planet Earth by weaving them into innovative items."
  content: "With the vision of creating a sustainable world without textile and plastic wastes, it became necessary for us at Planet 3R to reduce the landfill space by recycling clothes and nylons.</p>In my quest to creating more impact, I realized many people in my community usually dump textile and plastic wastes by the road side while some even go to the extent of burning them thereby depleting the ozone layer which is hazardous to our health and environment thus prompted me to use my weaving skills at Jokelinks to create an innovative solution by starting planet 3R initiative.</p>Our initiative focuses on the empowerment of unemployed youths by training them on effective ways to earn income from recycling plastic and textile waste.  We weave the wastes into eco-friendly products. We also engage in Grassroots and Creative Awareness programs geared Towards Achieving a Clean Environment."
